LESSON 16 DAY 5 - AVERAGE HEIGHT
THE FOR LOOP
Instructions


You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.
180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
1146 ÷ 7 = 163.71428571428572
Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

Example Input 1
156 178 165 171 187
In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

Example Output 1
total height = 857
number of students = 5
average height = 171

Example Input 2
151 145 179

Example Output 2
total height = 475
number of students = 3
average height = 158

# Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
  
# Write your code below this row 👇
number_of_students = (student_heights)
SOLUTION: 
# Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
  
# Write your code below this row 👇
# To calculate total height
total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
  total_height += height
print(f"total height = {total_height}")

# Total number of students
number_of_students = 0
for student in student_heights:
  number_of_students += 1
print(f"number of students = {number_of_students}")

average_height = total_height/number_of_students
answer = round(average_height)
print(f"average height = {answer}")


LESSON 18 DAY 5 - ADDING EVEN NUMBERS
Instructions
You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to X. If X is 100 then the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

Also, we will constrain the inputs to only take numbers from 0 to a max of 1000.

Example Input 1
10
Example Output 1
30
target = int(input()) # Enter a number between 0 and 1000
# 🚨 Do not change the code above ☝️

# Write your code here 👇
total = 0
for number in range (1, target+1):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    total += number
print(total)
