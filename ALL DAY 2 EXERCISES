TOPIC : Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

LESSON 5 DAY 2 - DATA TYPES
Instructions
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
Warning. Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.
The last line of your program should print the result.
Example 1 Input
39
Example 1 Output
12
Example 2 Input
43
Example 2 Output
7

SOLUTION: 
two_digit_number = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
####################################
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# print(type(two_digit_number))
first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])
print(first_digit + second_digit)


LESSON 6 DAY 2 - BMI CALCULATOR
Instructions
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
BMI Wikipedia Page
The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.
Example Input 1
1.75
80
means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75
Example Output 1
26
Since: 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
Example Input 2
1.58
57
Example Output 1
22
0:18

SOLUTION: 
# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# check type of input
  # print(type(height))
  # print(type(weight))
BMI = int(weight) / (float(height) ** 2)
# print(BMI)
# # what is the data type of BMI
# print(type(BMI))
# convert float to int
print(int(BMI))


LESSON 7 DAY 2 - LIFE IN WEEKS

Instructions
I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
You have x weeks left.
Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.
Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example Input
56
Example Output
You have 1768 weeks left.

SOLUTION:
age = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# Method 1:
# Convert age input to integer
int_age = int(age)
# Calculate years left: substract 90 - number of year int
remaining_year = 90 - int_age
# print(remaining_year)
# Calculate months left: remaining_year * 12
remaining_month = remaining_year * 12
# print(remaining_month)

# Calculate weeks left: remaining_year * 52
remaining_weeks = remaining_year * 52
# print(remaining_weeks)

# Calculate days left: remaining_year * 365
# remaining_days = remaining_year * 365
# print(remaining_days)
print(f"You have {remaining_weeks} weeks left.")

Day 2 Project: Tip Calculator

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
print("welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("what was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("how much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?"))
people = int(input("how many people to split the bill?"))

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
tip_as_percent = tip / 100

#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
print(round(final_amount))
